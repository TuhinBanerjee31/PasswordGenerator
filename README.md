# Lessons Learned

I created my first application for both Android and iOS using React Native CLI. Throughout the development process, I gained valuable experience handling various components in React Native, such as StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity, ScrollView, SafeAreaView, and Linking. Additionally, I delved into the realm of new npm packages, specifically 'formik,' which enabled me to efficiently create forms and manage form data and state. I also familiarized myself with 'Yup,' a powerful package for validating user-entered details against a predefined form schema, ensuring robust validation processes.
